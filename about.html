            <div class="bio">
                <p>I love code. I love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I
                    know JavaScript
                    is imperfect, but I embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. I like to talk
                    about
                    obscure computer science topics, but really, I just want to write simple code and ship new products
                    and
                    features to customers (or improve existing ones). I love great UX. I spend most of my time
                    coding,
                    but I also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. I aspire to become a designer but
                    my
                    creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, I care about more than just the code. I love
                    learning
                    new things. I love playing with new tech. I focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but I can dig in
                    wherever
                    needed. Python, CSS, build tools, you name it. If I don't already know it, I'm ready to learn it. I
                    can
                    balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and
                    devices
                    that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing
                    ecosystem
                    of languages and modules, and the list goes on. I can balance those demands without getting
                    overwhelmed
                    and keep the needle moving forward. I love helping others. I love sharing knowledge with the rest
                    of
                    my team, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p>
